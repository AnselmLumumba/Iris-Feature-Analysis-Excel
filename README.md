Project Overview
The goal of this project is to explore the relationships between various features of the Iris flower dataset, specifically focusing on sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Using Excel, we aim to draw meaningful conclusions through data analysis techniques.

Dataset
We use the Iris dataset, a well-known dataset available from trusted sources like the UCI Machine Learning Repository. Ensure the dataset is clean and ready for analysis by checking for any missing or incorrect values.

Analysis Steps
Basic Statistics: Calculate fundamental statistics (mean, median, mode, range, variance, and standard deviation) for each feature using Excel functions such as:

=AVERAGE()
=MEDIAN()
=MODE()
etc.
Visualizations: Create Excel visualizations to explore:

Distribution of each feature
Comparison across features
Relationships between two features
Correlation Analysis: Calculate the correlation between features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) using Excel's =CORREL(array1, array2) function. Then, construct a correlation matrix to understand the interrelationships among features.

Report
After completing the analysis, students will summarize their findings in a brief report. This report should include:

Visualizations
Statistical results
Key insights and conclusions about feature relationships in the dataset
